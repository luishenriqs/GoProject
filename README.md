# GoProject — Postgraduate Studies in Go Expert (Full Cycle)

This repository contains exercises, practices, and projects developed during my **Go Expert Postgraduate Program** offered by [Full Cycle](https://fullcycle.com.br).  
The goal is to consolidate the knowledge gained in each module through practical implementations in Go (Golang), covering fundamentals, clean architecture, concurrency, APIs, testing, and deployment.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
Serve as a **study platform** where I apply, organize, and version all content learned in the postgraduate program.  
Here you will find incremental implementations related to the core pillars of the Go language and its modern ecosystem.

## 📚 Program Content — Learning Pillars

The program is structured into **6 main pillars**, each with applied projects and exercises that will be explored in this repository:

1. **Go Fundamentals**
   - Strong typing, arrays, slices, maps  
   - Functions, structs, interfaces, and generics  
   - Packages, modules, and workspaces  

2. **Automated Testing**
   - Unit tests, mocks, and benchmarks  
   - Testify, fuzzing, and end-to-end testing  

3. **API Development**
   - HTTP servers, routers (chi, mux)  
   - JWT authentication and Swagger documentation  
   - Integrations with gRPC and GraphQL  

4. **Performance & Multithreading**
   - Goroutines, channels, mutex, and wait groups  
   - Race condition prevention  
   - Workers and load balancer implementations  

5. **Go & Clean Architecture**
   - Layered separation (use cases, DTOs, entities)  
   - Database and message broker adapters (RabbitMQ)  
   - CLI and HTTP endpoints with Clean Architecture  

6. **Golang Internals**
   - Scheduler, garbage collector, and memory management  
   - Arrays, slices, and interface internals  
   - Diagnostics and performance profiling
